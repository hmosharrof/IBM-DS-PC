To work in git on your own seperate branch 

Create your own branch:

$ git branch mybranch

Now switch to your branch

$ git checkout mybranch

Check the status 

$ git status 

The above command will show that you are in your "mybranch"

Now you can create a new file or what ever you want to add code locally. After that you need to push the updates from yopur local repository to remote

$ git push --set-upstream origin mybranch

So you can visit your github link and see there are two branches now you need to merge your "mybranch" with your master branch.

First need to switch your master.
 **Locally you are switching**
 
$ git checkout master
$ git merge mybranch

**now you need to push the local merge into remote repository**

$ git push
